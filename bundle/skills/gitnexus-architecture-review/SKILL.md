# Architecture review with GitNexus

`gitnexus-exploring`/`imaging` help you *understand* a codebase; this skill *judges* it — and backs every claim with a graph query, not vibes.

## When to Use

- "Review the architecture / call out structural problems"
- "Where is the coupling / are layers respected?"
- "Find import cycles, god objects, dead seams"
- Pre-refactor scoping, or a design-health pass

## Workflow

```
1. READ gitnexus://repo/{name}/clusters     → functional areas + cohesion scores (low = poorly factored)
2. READ gitnexus://repo/{name}/processes    → long/tangled flows = candidate hotspots
3. check({cycles: true})                    → circular File IMPORTS (hard structural smell)
4. cypher: cross-cluster CALLS              → coupling + layering violations (lower layer calling higher)
5. cypher: god objects                      → classes with many HAS_METHOD AND high fan-in
6. impact on hub symbols                    → load-bearing nodes (high blast radius = architectural risk)
```

> Stale index → `npm run gitnexus:agent-refresh` (autonomous).

## What to assess (and how)

| Finding | How to detect | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Import cycles** | `check({cycles: true})` | Cyclic deps block modularity, slow builds, break reasoning |
| **Low cohesion** | `clusters` cohesion score | An area doing too many unrelated things |
| **High coupling / layering violation** | `cypher` cross-cluster `CALLS` (e.g. `core` → `ui`, `repo` → `controller`) | Wrong-direction dependency erodes the architecture |
| **God object** | `cypher` classes with many `HAS_METHOD` + many callers | Single point that everything touches |
| **Load-bearing hub** | `impact` upstream (huge d=1) | Change here is high-risk; candidate to split/stabilize |
| **Dead seam** | `cypher` symbols with 0 callers / `route_map` orphan routes | Cruft to remove |

## Cypher starters (READ schema first)

```cypher
// Cross-area CALLS — coupling between functional areas
MATCH (a)-[:CodeRelation {type:'CALLS'}]->(b)
WHERE a.community <> b.community
RETURN a.community AS from, b.community AS to, count(*) AS edges
ORDER BY edges DESC

// God-object candidates — wide classes with high fan-in
MATCH (c:Class)-[:CodeRelation {type:'HAS_METHOD'}]->(m)
WITH c, count(m) AS methods
MATCH (caller)-[:CodeRelation {type:'CALLS'}]->(c)
RETURN c.name, methods, count(caller) AS callers
ORDER BY methods + callers DESC
```

## Checklist

```
- [ ] clusters → note low-cohesion areas
- [ ] check(cycles) → list every import cycle (cite the file ring)
- [ ] cypher cross-cluster CALLS → coupling hotspots + wrong-direction (layering) edges
- [ ] cypher → god objects / wide high-fan-in classes
- [ ] impact on top hubs → quantify blast radius (the refactor priority list)
- [ ] Report: each finding + the query that proves it + a concrete remediation
```

## Example output

```
Findings (evidence-backed):
- CYCLE: payments/index.ts → billing/tax.ts → payments/index.ts  (check cycles)
- LAYERING: data/UserRepo CALLS api/UserController  (cross-cluster, wrong direction)
- GOD OBJECT: AppContext — 41 methods, 180 callers  (split by concern)
- HUB: validateRequest — impact d=1 = 63  (stabilize before touching)
Priority: break the payments↔billing cycle first (blocks independent testing).
```
